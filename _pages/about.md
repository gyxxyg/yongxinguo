I'm a third-year PhD student in the Chinese University of HongKong, Shenzhen, very fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoying Tang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tangxiaoying) and Prof. [Tao Lin](https://tlin-taolin.github.io/). Prior to that, I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering degree from NanKai University, College of Software Engineering.
